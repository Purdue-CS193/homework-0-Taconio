- Before this I wasn't very familiar with github (I used it mostly to download indie games) so this homework was fun as an introduction.
- Distinguished selection of memes. 
- The ice breakers were surprisingly fun.
- Im learnign how to use Linux so this class focusing on that is also very good for me.
- Great HW 0 hacker theme B).
